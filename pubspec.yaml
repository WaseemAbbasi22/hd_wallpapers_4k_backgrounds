  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Manrope
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope/Manrope-Regular.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope/Manrope-Medium.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope/Manrope-SemiBold.ttf
